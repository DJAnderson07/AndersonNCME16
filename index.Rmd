## Cohort and Content Variability in Value-Added Model School Effects

## Introduction
<p class='slide'><strong>Value added Models, or VAMs:</strong></p>
 > * Are intended to measure the effect of teachers and/or schools on students' achievement
 > * Establishing the stability (reliability) of the models is prerequisite to establishing validity, which is foundational for their use in high-stakes policy applications

<p class='slide'><strong>Study purpose</strong></p>
> * Evaluate the stability of school-level VAM estimates across *cohorts* and *content area*.

---
## Cohort effects
> * VAMs assume estimates do not depend on the specific sample of students modeled.
> * Typically, only one year of data is included in estimates.
	- Estimates may then be representative of policy or implementation effects
	- Student mobility is high in many schools
> * If school effects do depend, in part, on sampling variability, then the validity of estimates is threatened 

---
## Content effects
> * Little research has explicitly explored the difference in school rankings by the content area.

> * Much research has investigated school effects in a single content area, while ignoring others <span style = "color:gray"> `r knitcitations::citep(bib[[c("Raudenbush86", "Raudenbush95")]])` </span>

> * Should we expect schools to have the same effect across content areas? What does it mean if different effects are observed?


---
## Research Questions
> 1. What is the stability of school effect estimates across *cohorts* and *content area* (reading and math)?
> 2. What proportion of the variance in students' scores is attributable to *school*, *cohort*, or *content* facets?
> 3. How does the number of cohorts modeled impact the reliability of school effect estimates?

---
## Methods: Sample
<p class='slide'>
### Demographics
```{r demoTable, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
dems <- as.data.frame(percDems)

knitr::kable(dems,
	col.names = "Proportion",
	digits = 2)
```
</p>

<br>
> * Operational statewide accountability data
> * Three cohorts of  students matched longitudinally across Grades 3-5 (approximately `r cohSize` students per cohort)
> * `r nSch` schools, with an average of `r nByJ_Mean` students per school (*SD* = `r nByJ_SD`)

----
## Analysis plan
> 1. Fit a VAM to each cohort of students in each content area
> 2. Explore changes in schools' normative rank across models
> 3. Fit a combined model across cohorts
> 4. Use Generaliziability Theory to (a) estimate the reliability of school effects, and (b) project reliability, given a change in the number of cohorts modeled.

## Basic school-effects model
$$
RIT_{ig} = \alpha + \beta_1(g4) + \beta_2(Pr \times g3_4) + 
	\beta_3(Pr \times g3_5) + \beta_4(Pr \times g4_5) + r_i + u_j + e_{ij}
$$

> * $RIT_{ig}$: State test score in Grade $g$ for student $i$ (includes both students' Grade 4 and Grade 5 data)
> * $\alpha$: Model intercept (mean Grade 5 scores, given average Grade 3 and 4 scores)
> * $g4$: Dummy code indicating if the outcome was in Grade 4 (rather than Grade 5)
> * $Pr$: Students prior state test score
	+ $g3_4$: Grade 3 prior state test score, Grade 4 outcome
	+ $g3_5$: Grade 3 prior state test score, Grade 5 outcome
	+ $g4_5$: Grade 4 prior state test score, Grade 5 outcome
> * $r_i$ and $u_j$: Random by-student and by-school variation
	+ $r_i \sim N(0, \sigma_{stu})$ 
	+ $u_j \sim N(0, \sigma_{sch})$
> * $e_{ij}$: Unmodeled residual variance
	+ $e_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma_{e})$

## Breaking the model apart

### Grade 4 outcome
$$
RIT_{i4} = \alpha + \beta_1(g4) + \beta_2(Pr \times g3_4) + r_i + u_j + e_{ij}
$$

### Grade 5 outcome
$$
RIT_{i5} = \alpha + \beta_3(Pr \times g3_5) + r_i + u_j + e_{ij} \\\
RIT_{i5} = \alpha  + \beta_4(Pr \times g4_5) + r_i + u_j + e_{ij}
$$

## Fixed-effects portion of the model

<img src = assets/img/Model.png width = 750 height = 500>
</div>

Note the residual variances were constrained to be equal

----
## Combined model
$$
RIT_{ig} = \alpha + \beta_1(g4) + \beta_2(Pr \times g3_4) + 
	\beta_3(Pr \times g3_5) + \beta_4(Pr \times g4_5) + \\ 
  r_i + u_j + v_c + v_cu_j + e_{ij}
$$

> * $v_c$: Random cohort variation
	+ $v_c \sim N(0, \sigma_{coh})$
> * $v_cu_j$: Random cohort by school variation (latent interaction variable)
	+ $v_cu_j \sim N(0, \sigma_{cohSch})$

----
## G-Theory
Relative reliability coefficient
$$
G = \frac{\sigma_{sch}^2}{\sigma_{sch}^2 + 
							\frac{\sigma_{cohSch}^2}{n_{coh}'} +
							\frac{\sigma_{e}^2}{n_{stu}'n_{coh}'}
							}
$$

Absolute reliability coefficient

$$
\Phi = \frac{\sigma_{sch}^2}{\sigma_{sch}^2 + 
							\frac{\sigma_{stu}^2}{n_{stu}'} +
							\frac{\sigma_{coh}^2}{n_{coh}'} +
							\frac{\sigma_{cohSch}^2}{n_{coh}'} +
							\frac{\sigma_{e}^2}{n_{stu}'n_{coh}'}
							}
$$

----
## Discussion
> * VAMs applied in high-stakes policy settings generally assume the estimates are independent of sampling variability.
	* Results of this study suggest high variability depending on the specific cohort of students modeled 
> * Generally, a single number is used to quantify the school effect
	* Results of this study indicate a more nuanced and multidimensional representation may be  more appropriate
> * Projected reliability was moderate when a single cohort was modeled
	* Reliability increased dramatically with the inclusion of even one additional cohort

----
## Limitations and future directions
> * This study investigated "pure" cohort effects, but annual estimates may be more reflective of how the models are applied in practice.
	* What's the year-to-year stability? 
> * Unclear the extent to which changes in school ranks were attributable to sampling variability versus "true" changes in school functioning 
> * School persistence was not modeled directly
